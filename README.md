# Swim Workout Logger
An app intended to be a PWA designed to ease the creation and analysis of swim workouts.

Note: This is in the very early stages of planning. Development is expected to start mid August.

## Phase 1 (Mid Aug to End Aug)
- Workout creation via image, text, and UI (minimum)
- Export workout as PDF

## Phase 2 (Start Sep to End Dec)
- Profile creation

## Phase 3 (Start Jan to Mid Jan)
- More advanced analytics (i.e. best averages for similar sets)

## Phase 4 (Sometime in the future)
- Compare with best times (maybe upload data from [SwimRankings.com](SwimRankings.com))
